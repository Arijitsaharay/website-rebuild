# project-2
This is a project made to rebuild and try to get to the original 'Jon Chretien website'. It should be excatly the same.
here is the original website: jonchretien.com


## Technologies used: 

I used CSS, HTML, Flexbox, and CSS Grids to build this website. 

I used the @import feature as well as pulled fonts from Google apis which gave my version of the 
website a better look.

## Get Access to using the technologies I used:

### CSS Grids: https://cssgrid.io/

### Flexbox: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
